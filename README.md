# Portal 2 Beemod 2.4.45.2 mods
In this .zip file I uploaded you'll find almost all UCPs (User Created Packages) addons present in the Beemod server so you don't have to download all of them individually. If you want to enter the Beemod server here's the link: https://discord.gg/hnGFJrz.
# How to install the addons in the .zip file
If you want to install these UCPs you obviously need Beemod (and if you haven't already watch this quick tutorial: https://youtu.be/FINQiERS8AE?si=dDc-cLDhBQgQYugY I know it's A LITTLE outdated but it's the best you can find in all Youtube). Extract the .zip file you just downloaded in the "packages" folder inside Beemod and you're done. Run BEE2.exe and you should have the items, enjoy.
# How to install any ".bee_pack" file step by step
After you find an addon you like in the "ucp-releases" in the beemod server (or anywhere else) open the link in the message and it will open github, after that click and download the .bee_pack file and drag it in the "packages" folder in beemod and you're done.
